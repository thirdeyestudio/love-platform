# love-platform
A platformer game example with [LÃ¶ve 2D](https://love2d.org). It was built doing [Kyle Schaub's](http://kyleschaub.com/) Udemy course for love2d. It's an excellent course to learn the basics and can be found [here](https://www.udemy.com/lua-love/)

# Installing & running the game

First you will need to get the love2d app for your operating system. Download it from the [love2d.org](https://love2d.org/) home page.

If you're using MacOS or Linux, make an alias to the love2d command. Add it to your bash/zsh profile for convenience. For example, in MacOS using `zsh` you can:

```bash
$ echo "alias love='/Applications/love.app/Contents/MacOS/love'" >> ~/.zshrc
$ source ~/.zshrc
```

Next, clone this repo:

```bash
$ git clone git@github.com/thirdeyestudio/love-platform
```

Once cloned, you can run it:

```bash
path/to/love-platform $ love .
```
